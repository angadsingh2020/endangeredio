          <h3 class="testimonial-text">May become threatened or endangered by biological reasons and identified threats. The main threat is rapid climate change in the Arctic circle near Canada. Most Narwhals are found in these waters as well. Most Narwhals live up to the age of fifty. People who live in the Arctic Circle, hunt narwhals for vitamin C in their diet. A Narwhal tusk can sell up to up to 10,000 dollars which is why some people hunt Narwhals. There are about 80,000 Narwhals left and they need to be protected because they’re at the top of their food chain. If Narwhals were to go extinct the whole Arctic ecosystem, in the water, would be thrown off because there will be a lot of prey for the Narwhals to eat, but no Narwhals. The prey of the Narwhal would start growing rapidly. An example is a squid. The squid population would grow exponentially and the prey of squid would also go extinct as there is a higher chance of them getting eaten.

          <h2 class="title-2323">Orangutans</h2>
          <h3 class="testimonial-text">The Orangutan is critically endangered. Their population is decline fast because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting. Erik Mejiaard, a member of IUCN SSC Primates Specialist Group, said, “As Orangutans are hunted and pushed to of their habitats, losses to this slow-breeding species are enormous and will be extremely difficult to reverse. Orangutans are keystone species, meaning that the ecosystem needs them. A keystone species is a species that is important to the ecosystem and without the ecosystem will fail. Orangutan help with seed distribution for many different plant species in the rainforest. Without Orangutans, the whole rainforest ecosystem will be disrupted. A lot of other animals, such as rhinos and tigers which are both near extinction, will be harmed.

          <h2 class="title-2323">Penguins</h2>
          <h3 class="testimonial-text">Penguins are the second most endangered birds. 55% of penguins are threatened.  IUCN has listed ten penguin species as endangered. Why are these birds so endangered? The largest danger to penguins is climate change, changing oceanic conditions. Ice caps are melting and sea levels are rising making it hard for penguins to adapt to their new environment. Also, there are commercial fisheries that purposely find where penguins are and set up their machinery to catch fish. Smaller penguins sometimes get caught. Also, this requires penguins to compete with the fisheries for food, which they’re not used to. With humans come their feline pets, which feast on penguin chicks and vulnerable adults. Penguin Awareness Day is celebrated annually on January 20. There are a lot of things that you can do to help penguins and we should.

          <h3 class="testimonial-text">The red panda's habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. There are less than 10,000 pandas left, with the population dwindling every year as the life span of a red panda is in the range of 10-12 years. This is happening because of poaching, trafficing, and illegal trading. The red panda is 2 feet in length; its scientific name is Ailurus fulgens. The red panda is very skillful and can climb up trees. They use their tails to cover themselves during the winter and are primary herbivores. Like regular pandas, their main diet consists of bamboo as bamboo is rich in proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, fibers, and minerals and contains little fat.

Individual tigers have large territories and mark their territory using urine or feces. Tigers are often poached because of their fur. The average tiger’s lifespan is 20 years and at any given moment a tiger can consume up to eighty pounds. The infant mortality rate in tigers is very high and most don’t reach over the age of 2.
